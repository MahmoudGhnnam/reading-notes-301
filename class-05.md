# Heroku

![float](img/class-05/heroku.png)

Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

Heroku focuses relentlessly on apps and the developer experience around apps. Heroku lets companies of all sizes embrace the value of apps, not the distraction of hardware, nor the distraction of servers - virtual or otherwise.

## What is Heroku Used For?

The Heroku cloud service platform is based on a managed container (called dynos within the Heroku paradigm) system with integrated data services and a powerful ecosystem for deploying and running modern applications.

## Why enabling developers matters

Great apps come from developers using tools and languages they love. That’s why a great developer experience has always been at the very heart of what we do. We embrace the languages of the modern app economy: Node, Ruby, Java, Scala, PHP and more.

Heroku makes the processes of deploying, configuring, scaling, tuning, and managing apps as simple and straightforward as possible, so that developers can focus on what’s most important: building great apps that delight and engage customers.

Deploying and maintaining apps should be frictionless, and these capabilities should be a part of a company's DNA.

## Heroku and data

Heroku is a platform for data as well as apps - providing a secure, scalable database-as-a-service with tons of developers tools like database followers, forking, dataclips and automated health checks.
